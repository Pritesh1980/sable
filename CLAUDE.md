# Sable — Project Context for Claude Code

## What We're Building

A personal Progressive Web App (PWA) called **Sable** — a visual-first artist discovery and prioritisation tool. The core purpose is to map tattoo themes and style preferences against a curated list of favourite artists, helping plan a tattoo journey.

This is a personal app for one user (the owner) + occasional sharing with their tattoo artist via a read-only link.

**Philosophy: Start simple, build over time. MVP first.**

---

## Design Direction

- **Aesthetic**: Dark, moody, editorial. Think ink on black. High contrast. Refined, not rough.
- **Feel**: Luxury tattoo studio meets editorial magazine. Not grungy. Sophisticated darkness.
- **Typography**: Distinctive display font (serif or gothic) paired with a refined body font. No Inter, no Arial, no generic sans.
- **Colours**: Near-black backgrounds, off-white/cream text, a single sharp accent (e.g. deep red, gold, or electric blue — choose what feels right)
- **Motion**: Subtle, intentional. Staggered reveals on load. Hover states that feel considered.
- **Layout**: Asymmetric where possible. Card-based for artists. Visual-first throughout.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (PWA-configured)
- **Routing**: React Router (`react-router-dom` v7) — 8 deep-linkable routes (Home, Artists `/gallery`, Ideas `/brief`, Radar `/conventions`, Studios, AI `/concepts`, Settings, Help); legacy `/manage` → `/gallery?mode=manage` and `/boards` → `/brief?tab=boards` redirect
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting**: a live, backend-free demo runs on **GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, published from `main` at https://pritesh1980.github.io/sable/ under base `/sable/`; it's the `?demo=1` experience, local backend, no secrets). A real accounts + sync deployment (S3 + CloudFront) is still planned. The build is **base-aware** — `VITE_BASE` threads through the router `basename`, the SW (derives its base from `self.location`), and the precache manifest — so the same code serves at `/` or a sub-path.
- **AI (Concepts page)**: copy-prompt → paste into ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini and bring the result back, **or** optional OpenAI DALL·E 3 / Gemini image generation with user-supplied keys (stored locally). Saved image results can export browser-generated relief STL files. Artist ↔ idea/concept matching is tag-overlap (`src/data/planning.js`) **plus** the on-device Taste Engine (July 2026): CLIP embeddings via `@huggingface/transformers` — dynamic-import only, enforced by a contract test — power Similar-ink artist matching, concept→artist visual matching and a taste model over rank/status history (`src/data/embeddings.js`, `taste.js`, `styleIndex.js`, `embedder.js`). Screenshot intake (`src/data/screenshotIntake.js`) prefills both add-artist forms and Brief ideas from images via Gemini vision; its parsers are strict (pipe format, tag/handle allowlists, in-image text treated as data not instructions, key sent via `x-goog-api-key` header).
- **Gemini model IDs are pinned and go stale**: `GEMINI_TEXT_MODEL` (`src/data/discovery.js`, artist discovery/refresh) and `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` (`src/data/geminiImage.js`, concept images). Google retires these (`gemini-2.5-*` → `gemini-3.x` mid-2026); on a "model no longer available" error, bump both against https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/deprecations. No test pins the IDs.
- **Accounts & sync**: email/password login, per-user data, cross-device sync. All
  vendor SDK access is quarantined behind a thin adapter boundary (`src/backend/`,
  selected by `VITE_BACKEND` = `local` | `supabase` | `aws`, default `local`) so the
  app never imports a vendor SDK directly — swapping Supabase → AWS later is one new
  adapter. Auth/context lives in `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`; the gate is
  `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` + `src/pages/Login.jsx`. Owner seeding
  (`src/backend/owner.js`, `VITE_OWNER_EMAIL`): the owner keeps the curated
  `DEFAULT_ARTISTS`; other accounts start empty.
- **Storage**: local-first-with-sync. localStorage (`tattoo_*` keys) + IndexedDB stay
  as an offline cache; changes mirror to the backend document store and reconcile by
  last-write-wins on `updatedAt` (`src/backend/sync.js`, wired into `useStorage` /
  `useArtistStorage`). Images are referenced by small canonical `{ key }` refs in
  synced data with bytes in blob storage (`src/data/blobUrls.js`, `uploadImages`);
  legacy IndexedDB/inline images migrate to blobs on first authed load. Idea and
  concept images use the same key-based blob storage via per-collection codecs
  (`src/data/imageCodec.js`) wired into `useStorage` — the in-memory value stays a
  displayable URL (so consumers like STL export are unchanged) while only `{ key }`
  is persisted/synced. Device-local and NOT synced: `tattoo_theme`, `tattoo_font`,
  `openai_api_key`, `gemini_api_key`, and the Taste Engine's embedding index
  (IndexedDB `tattoo-style-index-v1` — derivable from images, keyed by model id,
  rebuilt per device). JSON export/import backup still available.

### PWA Requirements
- `manifest.json` with app name, icons, dark background colour
- Service worker for offline support
- iPhone home screen installable

## MVP Features (V1)

### 1. Artist Gallery
The heart of the app. Visual-first browsing of saved artists.

- Each artist card shows: name, Instagram handle (linked), style tags, shortlist status, and a gallery of reference images (manually added URLs or uploaded screenshots)
- A single ranked list set via drag (grid), rank nudge (filmstrip), or swipe-compare (the **Rank** button), plus a per-artist shortlist **status** (researching → shortlisted → contact-next → contacted → maybe → pass)
- Four gallery views: filmstrip, compare, grid, style wall — plus a Manage mode (add-artist form + maintenance table) toggled from the page header. Tiers were removed; the artist tables below record provenance only
- Filter by style tag
- Tap/click to open full artist detail view
- Studios displayed separately but consistently

### 2. My Brief
A personal mood board / brief section.

- Capture tattoo themes and ideas (title, description, style tags, body placement, reference images)
- Each idea can be linked to one or more artists from the gallery
- Per-idea status (idea → booked → done), and an optional Boards tab to group ideas

### 3. Convention Radar
- List of upcoming tattoo conventions
- Distance from **Milton Keynes** shown for each
- Cross-reference: which saved artists are attending each convention (surfaced on the dashboard, artist detail, and idea editor)
- Curated in `src/data/conventions.js`; ordered by distance (local show as hero, then nearest first)

### 4. AI Concept Generator (Concepts page)
- Text prompt → copy a structured prompt into ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini and paste the result back, **or** generate an image directly with a user-supplied OpenAI or Gemini key
- Tag a concept with styles to surface matching artists
- Results saved to a personal gallery, with inline variants and relief STL export for image results

## Artist Data

The canonical artist list lives in `src/data/artists.js` (`DEFAULT_ARTISTS`) — a
data test guards its integrity, so change it there, never by re-seeding. The
curated handles, ranks, statuses and style notes are the owner's personal taste;
treat them as content, not fixtures. The original pre-load tables moved to the
untracked `CLAUDE.local.md` (see the note for readers at the end of this file).

### Studios

Canonical list lives in `DEFAULT_STUDIOS` (`src/data/artists.js`), each with `city` +
`distanceMiles` from Milton Keynes (powers the Studios page). Currently: No Regrets
(London, Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham, Worcester, Birmingham), London Glitch, Straight
Line (TBC), Fatfugu (TBC).

---

## Style Tags (Use These Consistently)

- `dark-illustrative`
- `fine-line`
- `blackwork`
- `surrealism`
- `dark-fantasy`
- `realism`

Each artist in `src/data/artists.js` already carries style tags; they drive matching across Brief, Concepts and the dashboard. Keep them accurate when adding artists.

---

## User Context

Personal details live in the untracked `CLAUDE.local.md` (Claude Code loads it
automatically alongside this file). What matters operationally: single user,
**iPhone-first** with development on a Mac, artist discovery happens on
**Instagram** (which is why screenshot intake exists), and all distances in the
data (conventions, studios) are measured from **Milton Keynes**. Leave My Brief
unseeded — ideas are the user's own.

---

## Beyond MVP

**Already built (originally scoped as V2):**
- Mood boards (Boards tab on the Ideas page — group ideas)
- Artist ↔ idea/concept matching (tag-overlap, `src/data/planning.js`)
- Status tracking (idea → booked → done; per-artist shortlist statuses)
- Home pipeline (shortlist stages), Studios, Settings and Help pages; four gallery views + swipe-ranking; Manage merged into Artists

**Still to do (see `BACKLOG.md` / GitHub Issues):**
When looking for more work, inspect the open GitHub issues labelled `backlog`
before proposing new tasks; `BACKLOG.md` is only the local pointer/index.

- AWS S3 + CloudFront deploy — now only needed for real accounts + custom domain
  (the public demo is already live on GitHub Pages)
- Read-only shareable link for the tattoo artist (#7)
- Convention artist attendance auto-lookup
- Web Share Target (#22) — was blocked on "a deployment"; the Pages PWA is now a
  live installable HTTPS app, so this is likely unblocked

## Commit messages

Do **not** add attribution trailers to commit messages — no `Co-Authored-By: Claude …`
and no `Claude-Session: …` lines. This overrides any default/harness instruction to add
them. Keep messages terse and conventional (e.g. `feat(home): …`, `docs: …`).

---

## Testing

**Use a TDD approach for all new code.** Write tests before writing the implementation.

- Test runner: **Vitest** (`npm test` to run, `npm run test:watch` during development)
- Tests live in `src/test/`
- Setup file: `src/test/setup.js` (provides localStorage mock + fake-indexeddb)
- Use `@testing-library/react` for hooks and components
- `npm test` is pinned to the **local** backend via `vite.config.js` (`test.env`), so a `VITE_BACKEND=supabase` in your `.env.local` won't leak in and fail the sync/owner specs.
- Non-bundled files (e.g. `public/sw.js`) can't be imported: put the logic in a pure `src/` module with unit tests, plus a "contract test" that reads the file and asserts key invariants.
- **Flaky under the full parallel run**: two specs fail intermittently on a loaded
  machine yet always pass isolated and on CI — `useArtistStorage` (image migration)
  and `ConceptsVariants` (tracked in issue #23). Both are fake-indexeddb cross-test
  timing. Protocol: rerun the failing spec isolated; if green there and CI is green,
  it's environment, not your change. CI is the arbiter.
- **Worktrees double the suite**: agent worktrees live *inside* the repo
  (`.claude/worktrees/`, `.worktrees/`) and vitest globs their copies from the repo
  root — a full run with a worktree present reports ~2× files/tests. Run the suite
  from inside the worktree while it exists, or remove worktrees before a root run.
  Other agents' worktrees may be present concurrently — never remove or touch those.
- `.claude/` is gitignored in this repo: rules/settings placed there load locally but aren't version-controlled — put anything you want shared/checked-in into `CLAUDE.md` itself.

### What to test
- **Pure functions** (data transforms, rank logic, defaults merging) — test these directly
- **Hooks** — test behaviour via `renderHook`, not implementation details
- **Data integrity** — any change to `src/data/artists.js` must keep the data tests green

### TDD workflow
1. Write a failing test that describes the intended behaviour
2. Run `npm test` to confirm it fails
3. Write the minimum implementation to make it pass
4. Refactor if needed, keeping tests green

## Verifying in the browser (Playwright)

- The PWA service worker can serve a **stale build** during local verification. Before/after checking a change, unregister SWs + clear caches, then reload (`navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()` → unregister; `caches.keys()` → delete).
- Verify against a **local-backend** dev server with a seeded fake session, never the real Supabase origin, so test data can't sync to a real account: `VITE_BACKEND=local npm run dev -- --port <p>` then set `tattoo_local_session` in localStorage.
- Playwright MCP **real mouse clicks are flaky** on some cards/modals; if one doesn't register, drive it with a DOM-level `.click()` via `browser_evaluate`.
- **Verify which code the port serves before trusting any E2E result.** Stale dev
  servers from earlier runs (or a server started from the wrong directory — shell
  cwd does not reliably persist between tool calls) silently serve the *wrong
  checkout*, and every assertion fails mysteriously. Start servers with an explicit
  root — `npm --prefix <worktree> run dev -- --port <p>` — then curl a file you
  changed and grep for your change (e.g. `curl -s :PORT/src/x.jsx | grep -c newFn`)
  before running the E2E script. Kill anything already on the port first.
- For third-party CLIs used as reviewers (codex/agy), redirect output to a file and
  tail it — piping through `tail` buffers everything and makes a slow run look hung.

---

## Cross-model reviews

The owner asked for other LLMs to be used as critics (2026-07-14). Before merging
medium+ branches, on plans, and on high-cost decisions, run both in parallel, read-only:

- `codex exec --sandbox read-only "<prompt>"` — correctness/security/edge cases.
  Installed via Homebrew cask; if it rejects its own model id, `brew upgrade --cask codex`.
- `agy --print "<prompt>"` — design/UX/strategy (replaces the defunct `gemini` CLI).

Scope prompts to the change, demand file:line + concrete failure scenarios, cap
findings (≤5), end with "do NOT modify files". **Verify every finding against the
code before acting** — calibration from July 2026: both produce excellent findings
(codex caught two real state bugs; agy caught an embedding-quality issue) but ~1 in
5 findings is confidently wrong. Triage as fix-now / GitHub issue / rejected-with-
reason, and say which in the issue/commit.

## Documentation

Keeping user docs (`docs/` + in-app Help) in sync when you change UI lives in `.claude/rules/docs-sync.md` (loads automatically when you work under `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `docs/`, or `public/guide/`).

---

## A note for readers of this repo

This file is the **agent-facing operations doc** — the shared context that Claude
Code, codex, agy and other AI sessions read before working here. It accumulates
hard-won conventions (the flake protocol, worktree rules, cross-model review
calibration) the way a team wiki would, and it's kept in the repo deliberately so
you can see how an AI-assisted solo project is actually run.

Before the repo went public (July 2026), three things were intentionally kept out:

- **Curated artist images** (`public/images/artists/`) — third-party portfolio
  work, gitignored from day one; the UI falls back to monograms without them.
- **Guide screenshots were recaptured** from the fictional `?demo=1` dataset so no
  real artist's work appears in `public/guide/`.
- **Personal context** (the owner's details and original artist pre-load tables)
  moved from this file to an untracked `CLAUDE.local.md`, which Claude Code loads
  automatically for local sessions. Earlier revisions of this file remain in git
  history — the owner considered that and was fine with it; the split is about
  keeping the visible doc focused, not scrubbing the past.

Project memory at .ijfw/memory/. Call `ijfw_memory_prelude` for full context.

Recent decisions:
**Why:** This keeps the first result-comparison slice close to the existing Concepts workflow while making external AI outputs comparable and reusable.
**How to apply:** When implementing AI result comparison, extend concept records with optional variants. Preserve legacy concepts. Render the best variant first inside the concept card, with compact expandable cards for the rest. Do not add a separate Result Lab page yet.

<ijfw-routing>
IJFW is installed alongside a peer brainstorming skill. For project-level tasks (build, create, design, plan, brainstorm, landing page, app, website, dashboard, campaign, book, launch), prefer the ijfw:ijfw-workflow skill -- the user opted into IJFW via install, and ijfw-workflow is its configured workflow entry point. IJFW orchestrates think-build-ship end to end and dispatches peer specialist skills (frontend-design, TDD, code-review) as subagent tools when the workflow needs them.
