# Tattoo — Project Context for Claude Code

## What We're Building

A personal Progressive Web App (PWA) called **Tattoo** — a visual-first artist discovery and prioritisation tool. The core purpose is to map tattoo themes and style preferences against a curated list of favourite artists, helping plan a tattoo journey.

This is a personal app for one user (Pritesh) + occasional sharing with his tattoo artist via a read-only link.

**Philosophy: Start simple, build over time. MVP first.**

---

## Design Direction

- **Aesthetic**: Dark, moody, editorial. Think ink on black. High contrast. Refined, not rough.
- **Feel**: Luxury tattoo studio meets editorial magazine. Not grungy. Sophisticated darkness.
- **Typography**: Distinctive display font (serif or gothic) paired with a refined body font. No Inter, no Arial, no generic sans.
- **Colours**: Near-black backgrounds, off-white/cream text, a single sharp accent (e.g. deep red, gold, or electric blue — choose what feels right)
- **Motion**: Subtle, intentional. Staggered reveals on load. Hover states that feel considered.
- **Layout**: Asymmetric where possible. Card-based for artists. Visual-first throughout.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (PWA-configured)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting**: AWS S3 + CloudFront (static site deployment)
- **AI**: Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) for concept image generation and artist style matching
- **Storage**: localStorage to start — easy to migrate later
- **No backend required for MVP**

### PWA Requirements
- `manifest.json` with app name, icons, dark background colour
- Service worker for offline support
- iPhone home screen installable

## MVP Features (V1)

### 1. Artist Gallery
The heart of the app. Visual-first browsing of saved artists.

- Each artist card shows: name, Instagram handle (linked), style tags, personal priority tier, and a gallery of reference images (manually added URLs or uploaded screenshots)
- Two starting tiers: **Favourite** (17 artists) and **Also Like** (5 artists)
- Drag-to-rank within tiers to set personal priority
- Filter by style tag
- Tap/click to open full artist detail view
- Studios displayed separately but consistently

### 2. My Brief
A personal mood board / brief section.

- Capture tattoo themes and ideas (title, description, style tags, body placement, reference images)
- Each idea can be linked to one or more artists from the gallery
- No status tracking in V1

### 3. Convention Radar
- List of upcoming tattoo conventions
- Distance from **Milton Keynes** shown for each
- Cross-reference: which saved artists are attending each convention
- Manual data entry for V1

### 4. AI Concept Generator
- Text prompt input → generated concept image via Claude API
- Results saved to a personal gallery
- Simple, clean interface

## How to Start

In Claude Code, run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest tattoo-app -- --template react
cd tattoo-app
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then say: **"Build the MVP per CLAUDE.md"**

---

## Testing

**Use a TDD approach for all new code.** Write tests before writing the implementation.

- Test runner: **Vitest** (`npm test` to run, `npm run test:watch` during development)
- Tests live in `src/test/`
- Setup file: `src/test/setup.js` (provides localStorage mock + fake-indexeddb)
- Use `@testing-library/react` for hooks and components

### What to test
- **Pure functions** (data transforms, rank logic, defaults merging) — test these directly
- **Hooks** — test behaviour via `renderHook`, not implementation details
- **Data integrity** — any change to `src/data/artists.js` must keep the data tests green

### TDD workflow
1. Write a failing test that describes the intended behaviour
2. Run `npm test` to confirm it fails
3. Write the minimum implementation to make it pass
4. Refactor if needed, keeping tests green

<!-- IJFW-MEMORY-START (managed -- do not edit manually) -->
<ijfw-memory>
Project memory at .ijfw/memory/. Call `ijfw_memory_prelude` for full context.

<ijfw-routing>
IJFW is installed alongside a peer brainstorming skill. For project-level tasks (build, create, design, plan, brainstorm, landing page, app, website, dashboard, campaign, book, launch), prefer the ijfw:ijfw-workflow skill -- the user opted into IJFW via install, and ijfw-workflow is its configured workflow entry point. IJFW orchestrates think-build-ship end to end and dispatches peer specialist skills (frontend-design, TDD, code-review) as subagent tools when the workflow needs them.
